# Admin Panel Security Management Requirements

**Date:** January 2026  
**Status:** 📋 Requirements Definition  
**Target Repository:** `pbx3sbc-admin` (Laravel + Filament)

## Overview

This document outlines the security management features that need to be added to the pbx3sbc-admin web interface. These features will allow administrators to view, manage, and monitor the security elements implemented in Phase 1.1, Phase 2.2, and Phase 3.3 of the Security Implementation Plan.

**Note:** Phase 3.3 (Statistics & Reporting) has been moved to the admin panel as it primarily involves data visualization, reporting, and statistics - these are user-facing features that belong in the web interface, not core OpenSIPS functionality.

## Security Features to Implement

### 3. Fail2ban Whitelist Management

**Configuration File:** `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/opensips-brute-force.conf`

**Features:**
- **View Whitelist** - List of currently whitelisted IPs and CIDR ranges
- **Add to Whitelist:**
  - Add single IP address
  - Add CIDR range
  - Add comment/description for each entry
- **Remove from Whitelist:**
  - Remove IP or CIDR range
  - Confirmation dialog before removal
- **Bulk Operations:**
  - Import from CSV
  - Export to CSV
- **Validation:**
  - Validate IP address format (IPv4 and IPv6)
  - Validate CIDR notation
  - Prevent duplicates

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Option A:** Direct file manipulation (read/write `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/opensips-brute-force.conf`)
  - Requires sudo/root access or proper permissions
  - Use Laravel's `Process` facade to execute `manage-fail2ban-whitelist.sh` script
- **Option B:** Database-backed whitelist (recommended)
  - Create `fail2ban_whitelist` table in database
  - Admin panel manages database table
  - Cron job or systemd service syncs database to Fail2ban config file
  - More secure (no direct file access needed)

**Recommended: Option B (Database-Backed)**

**Database Table:** `fail2ban_whitelist`
```sql
CREATE TABLE fail2ban_whitelist (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ip_or_cidr VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
    comment VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_by INT DEFAULT NULL,  -- Foreign key to users table
    UNIQUE KEY unique_ip_cidr (ip_or_cidr),
    INDEX idx_ip_cidr (ip_or_cidr)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

**Filament Resource:** `Fail2banWhitelistResource`
- Model: `Fail2banWhitelist` (Laravel model)
- Table: `fail2ban_whitelist`
- Actions: Create, Edit, Delete, View
- Form validation for IP/CIDR format

**UI Components:**
- Table view with IP/CIDR, comment, created date
- Create form (IP/CIDR input, comment textarea)
- Edit form (update comment)
- Delete action with confirmation
- Bulk import/export buttons

**Sync Script:** Create `scripts/sync-fail2ban-whitelist.sh` that:
1. Reads from `fail2ban_whitelist` table
2. Updates `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/opensips-brute-force.conf`
3. Restarts Fail2ban service
4. Can be run via cron or triggered from admin panel

---

### 4. Fail2ban Status & Monitoring

**Features:**
- **Jail Status** - View Fail2ban jail status (enabled, banned IPs, etc.)
- **Banned IPs List** - View currently banned IP addresses
- **Manual Actions:**
  - Ban IP manually
  - Unban IP manually
  - Unban all IPs
- **Statistics:**
  - Total banned IPs
  - Currently banned IPs count
  - Bans in last 24 hours
  - Top banned IPs (if history tracked)

**Implementation:**
- Use Laravel's `Process` facade to execute `fail2ban-client` commands
- Requires sudo access or proper permissions
- Consider using `sudoers` file to allow specific commands without password

**Commands to Execute:**
```bash
# Get jail status
fail2ban-client status opensips-brute-force

# Get banned IPs
fail2ban-client status opensips-brute-force | grep "Banned IP"

# Ban IP
fail2ban-client set opensips-brute-force banip <IP>

# Unban IP
fail2ban-client set opensips-brute-force unbanip <IP>

# Unban all
fail2ban-client set opensips-brute-force unban --all
```

**Filament Resource:** `Fail2banStatusResource`
- Not a database resource (no model)
- Custom Filament page or widget
- Real-time status display
- Action buttons for manual ban/unban

**UI Components:**
- Status card showing jail status
- Table of banned IPs with unban action
- Manual ban form (IP input, ban button)
- Statistics widgets

---

### 5. Security Statistics & Reporting (Phase 3.3)

**Objective:** Provide comprehensive security statistics and reporting

**Note:** This replaces Phase 3.3 from the Security Implementation Plan - statistics and reporting belong in the admin panel, not core OpenSIPS.

**Features:**

#### 5.1 Security Dashboard Widgets

- **Failed Registrations Widget:**
  - Count of failed registrations in last 24 hours
  - Chart showing trend over time (hourly/daily)
  - Top 5 source IPs
  - Failed registrations by domain
  - Failed registrations by response code
- **Door-Knock Attempts Widget:**
  - Count of door-knock attempts in last 24 hours
  - Chart showing trend over time (hourly/daily)
  - Top 5 source IPs
  - Door-knock attempts by reason
  - Door-knock attempts by method
- **Fail2ban Status Widget:**
  - Currently banned IPs count
  - Jail status (enabled/disabled)
  - Recent bans (last 10)
  - Bans in last 24 hours
- **Security Alerts Widget:**
  - High-risk IPs (many failures)
  - Recent security events
  - Recommendations (e.g., "Consider banning IP X")

**Filament Widgets:**
- `FailedRegistrationsStatsWidget`
- `DoorKnockAttemptsStatsWidget`
- `Fail2banStatusWidget`
- `SecurityAlertsWidget`

#### 5.2 Security Statistics Views

**Database Queries/Views (computed via Laravel, not SQL views):**
- `security_stats_hourly` - Hourly event counts (computed via Eloquent)
- `top_attacking_ips` - Top attacking IPs (computed via Eloquent)
- `registration_failure_stats` - Registration failure trends (computed via Eloquent)
- `door_knock_stats_by_reason` - Door-knock statistics by reason
- `security_trends_daily` - Daily security event trends

**Note:** Statistics can be computed via Laravel Eloquent queries. SQL views are optional optimization but not required.

#### 5.3 Reporting Features

- **Generate Security Reports:**
  - Date range selection
  - Filter by event type, IP, domain
  - Export to CSV/PDF
  - Email reports (optional)
- **Report Types:**
  - Failed registrations report
  - Door-knock attempts report
  - Combined security report
  - Top attacking IPs report
  - Security trends report

**Filament Resources:**
- `SecurityReportResource` (custom page for report generation)
- Export actions on FailedRegistrationResource and DoorKnockAttemptResource

## Database Schema Updates

### New Tables Needed

1. **`fail2ban_whitelist`** (for whitelist management)
   - See schema above

2. **Optional: `fail2ban_bans`** (for ban history tracking)
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE fail2ban_bans (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       ip_address VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
       banned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       unbanned_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
       reason VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL,
       INDEX idx_ip (ip_address),
       INDEX idx_banned_at (banned_at)
   ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
   ```
   - Track ban history for reporting
   - Can be populated by monitoring Fail2ban logs or via API

---

## Laravel Models

### Models to Create

1. **`FailedRegistration`**
   ```php
   namespace App\Models;
   
   use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
   
   class FailedRegistration extends Model
   {
       protected $table = 'failed_registrations';
       public $timestamps = false; // Table doesn't have created_at/updated_at
       
       protected $fillable = [
           'username', 'domain', 'source_ip', 'source_port',
           'user_agent', 'response_code', 'response_reason',
           'attempt_time', 'expires_header'
       ];
       
       protected $casts = [
           'attempt_time' => 'datetime',
           'source_port' => 'integer',
           'response_code' => 'integer',
           'expires_header' => 'integer',
       ];
   }
   ```

2. **`DoorKnockAttempt`**
   ```php
   namespace App\Models;
   
   use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
   
   class DoorKnockAttempt extends Model
   {
       protected $table = 'door_knock_attempts';
       public $timestamps = false;
       
       protected $fillable = [
           'domain', 'source_ip', 'source_port', 'user_agent',
           'method', 'request_uri', 'reason', 'attempt_time'
       ];
       
       protected $casts = [
           'attempt_time' => 'datetime',
           'source_port' => 'integer',
       ];
   }
   ```

3. **`Fail2banWhitelist`**
   ```php
   namespace App\Models;
   
   use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
   
   class Fail2banWhitelist extends Model
   {
       protected $table = 'fail2ban_whitelist';
       
       protected $fillable = [
           'ip_or_cidr', 'comment', 'created_by'
       ];
       
       public function creator()
       {
